# AI Output Validation Service: Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the step-by-step process for implementing the AI Output Validation Service using FastAPI and Pydantic v2, from initial setup to production deployment.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Implementation (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Environment Setup and Basic Structure

- [ ] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Initialize Git repository
- [ ] Set up virtual environment
- [ ] Install core dependencies (FastAPI, Pydantic v2, Uvicorn)
- [ ] Create basic `main.py` with "Hello World" endpoint
- [ ] Set up basic project documentation (README.md)

```bash
# Sample initialization commands
mkdir -p ai-validation-service/app
cd ai-validation-service
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install fastapi "pydantic>=2.0.0" "uvicorn[standard]"
git init
```

### Day 3-4: Core Functionality Implementation

- [ ] Define base Pydantic models for different validation types
- [ ] Implement validation endpoint logic
- [ ] Add error handling and response standardization
- [ ] Create custom validators for complex validation rules
- [ ] Write authentication middleware for API key verification

```python
# Sample validation endpoint
@app.post("/validate/{validation_type}")
async def validate_ai_output(
    data: Dict[str, Any],
    validation_type: ValidationType,
    api_key: str = Depends(verify_api_key)
):
    try:
        # Model selection logic
        # Validation logic
        return {"status": "valid", "validated_data": validated_data}
    except ValidationError as e:
        return {"status": "invalid", "errors": e.errors()}
```

### Day 5: Testing and Documentation

- [ ] Write unit tests for validation logic
- [ ] Implement health check endpoint
- [ ] Document API endpoints with OpenAPI descriptions
- [ ] Test all endpoints manually with sample data
- [ ] Update README with setup and usage instructions

## Phase 2: Containerization and Local Testing (Week 2)

### Day 1-2: Docker Setup

- [ ] Create Dockerfile
- [ ] Create docker-compose.yml for local development
- [ ] Set up environment variables configuration
- [ ] Build and test Docker image locally
- [ ] Document Docker commands in README

```dockerfile
# Sample Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

### Day 3-4: Enhanced Features and Security

- [ ] Implement rate limiting middleware
- [ ] Add request logging
- [ ] Create environment-specific configuration
- [ ] Implement additional validation models
- [ ] Set up CORS middleware

### Day 5: Integration Testing

- [ ] Create mock n8n workflow for testing
- [ ] Test API with various input scenarios
- [ ] Document common validation patterns
- [ ] Prepare for deployment

## Phase 3: Deployment to Hetzner via Coolify (Week 3)

### Day 1-2: Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] Create Hetzner Cloud account (if not already done)
- [ ] Provision server (2GB RAM, 1 vCPU minimum)
- [ ] Set up DNS records (if using custom domain)
- [ ] Install Coolify on server
- [ ] Secure server with basic firewall rules

```bash
# Sample command to install Coolify
curl -fsSL https://cdn.coollabs.io/coolify/install.sh | bash
```

### Day 3-4: Deployment Configuration

- [ ] Push code to Git repository
- [ ] Set up Coolify project
- [ ] Configure environment variables in Coolify
- [ ] Connect Git repository to Coolify
- [ ] Deploy initial version
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates (if using custom domain)

### Day 5: Deployment Verification and Monitoring

- [ ] Verify API endpoints are accessible
- [ ] Test authentication mechanism
- [ ] Set up basic monitoring (e.g., uptime checks)
- [ ] Document deployment process
- [ ] Create deployment checklist for future updates

## Phase 4: n8n Integration and Testing (Week 4)

### Day 1-2: n8n Workflow Setup

- [ ] Set up n8n instance (if not already available)
- [ ] Create test workflow with AI agent
- [ ] Configure HTTP Request node to call validation service
- [ ] Set up error handling in n8n workflow
- [ ] Test basic validation scenarios

### Day 3-4: Extended Testing and Optimization

- [ ] Test with various AI output formats
- [ ] Optimize validation performance
- [ ] Add caching for frequent validation requests (if needed)
- [ ] Document common integration patterns
- [ ] Create example workflows for different AI agents

### Day 5: Documentation and Knowledge Transfer

- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Document common validation patterns
- [ ] Create user guide for non-technical users
- [ ] Record demo video of the integration
- [ ] Finalize all documentation

## Phase 5: Production Readiness and Maintenance (Ongoing)

### Week 5: Final Production Setup

- [ ] Implement backup strategy
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create update and maintenance process
- [ ] Document incident response procedures
- [ ] Perform security audit

### Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Performance monitoring
- [ ] Add new validation models as needed
- [ ] Collect and analyze validation errors
- [ ] Implement user feedback

## Key Milestones

1. **MVP Ready** - End of Week 1
   * Basic validation endpoint working
   * API key authentication implemented
   * Core Pydantic models defined

2. **Local Development Complete** - End of Week 2
   * Docker container running
   * All endpoints tested
   * Documentation updated

3. **Initial Deployment** - Middle of Week 3
   * Service deployed to Hetzner
   * Endpoints accessible
   * Basic monitoring in place

4. **n8n Integration Complete** - End of Week 4
   * Working n8n workflow
   * Documentation completed
   * Integration tested with real AI outputs

5. **Production Ready** - End of Week 5
   * All security measures implemented
   * Monitoring and alerting in place
   * Maintenance procedures documented

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The validation service can accurately validate AI outputs against defined schemas
2. The service is deployed and accessible via HTTPS
3. n8n workflows can successfully integrate with the validation service
4. Error handling provides clear feedback on validation failures
5. Documentation is complete and easy to follow

## Technical Debt and Risk Management

- **API Key Management**: Initially using simple API keys, plan to implement more robust authentication in future updates
- **Schema Versioning**: Create a plan for managing schema changes without breaking existing integrations
- **Performance Monitoring**: Implement basic monitoring early to identify potential bottlenecks
- **Error Logging**: Ensure comprehensive error logging from day one to aid in troubleshooting
